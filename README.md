# breakout
This is my remake of the arcade game Breakout.

In this game, you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen, and you use the paddle to bounce a ball towards 
bricks at the top of the screen. Your goal is to destroy all the bricks without missing the ball with your paddle.
You can miss the ball twice, but on the third miss, it's game over.

The ball will bounce off the bricks in different directions depending on where it collides. If the ball destroys 
multiple bricks in a row before hitting the paddle, you'll gain bonus points for racking up a combo.

To run the game, you need to add the file "acm.jar" to your IDE's classpath.

I started this project in my high school computer science class. 
I was given a shell program with methods that enabled the user to move the paddle with their mouse and 
specified how the ball interacted with paddle. I added all the other on-screen objects and the scoring system to make
it a functional, entertaining game.
